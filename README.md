```

    ss = Screen Sharing
    ps = Photoshop

USAGE: show <app-name>

```

This utility lets me take a quick peek at whatever is going on in a shared session to another computer and hide it away without changing my focus from the terminal. Surely, I can't be the only one frustrated with the inconsistent use of âŒ˜-H in certain apps. (Looking at you Photoshop and Screen Sharing!) 

I also think this is particularly nice way of combining command-line development with `osascript`. I love how the toggle function turned out.
